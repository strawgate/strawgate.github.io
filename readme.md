# William Strawgate Easton

My name is Bill and I live in Madison, Wisconsin. I am an Cyber Security enthusiast and I spend my days building tools that help the largest organizations in the world protect their datacenter and operational environments.

# Experience

My Experience in Cyber Security includes: full-time product management, software devleopment, consulting volunteer work, and security disclosures to major organizations (Microsoft, IBM, Ivanti, and University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Open Source

In my free time I try to be a significant contributor to the communities that I am a part of -- I think I do the best job within the IBM BigFix community. I actively maintain a number of projects (C3) used by 100+ organizations from all industries and backgrounds including Federal, State, and Local Governments, Defense, Finance, Media, Retail, and Higher Education.

### C3 for IBM BigFix

C3 as a set of projects exists solely to help organizations hit the ground running with Endpoint Management. So many organizations invest significant time and money into developing content that could be applicable to more than just them but they never actually share what they are doing. In addition, many organizations take a long time to get effective use from their Endpoint Management tools due to the buildout required.

The goal of C3 is to do this buildout for them. C3 exists to provide a large collection of content that is general enough to be applicable everywhere but specific enough to solve problems organizations face today without modification. The best part about C3 is that it is currently used in production! C3 is made up primarily of content I have created but also relies on other community contributors.

My favorite project within C3 is called C3 Patch and it's a set of tools that automatically generates patches for third-party applications (80+ different applications!), tests them on a fleet of virtual machines and publishes them for immediate use.
