# William Strawgate Easton

## Introductions

My name is Bill and I live in Madison, Wisconsin. I am an Endpoint Management enthusiast and I spend my days using tools like IBM BigFix to do things they weren't meant to!

# Experience

My Experience in the Information Security field includes

## Open Source

I try to be a significant contributor to the communities that I am a part of -- I think I do the best job within the IBM BigFix community. I actively maintain a number of projects used by organizations from all industries and backgrounds including Federal, State, and Local Governments, Finance, Media, Retail, and Higher Education.

### C3 for IBM BigFix

C3 as a project exists solely to help organizations adhere to the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). So many organizations invest significant time and money into developing content that is applicable to more than just them. In addition, many organizations take a long time to really get effective use from their Endpoint Management tools due to the buildout required.

The goal of C3 is to do this buildout for them. C3 exists to provide a great collection of content that is general enough to be applicable everywhere but specific enough to solve problems organizations face today without modification. The best part about C3 is that it is currently used in production! It is a mix of content I have created, my friends have created and the community has created. Content not created by me is properly attributed (and if it’s not let me know and I’ll fix it!)
